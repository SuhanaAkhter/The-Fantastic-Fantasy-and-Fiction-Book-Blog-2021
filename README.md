# Udacity-Personal-Blog-Website
I made this website for the Udacity Personal Blog Website project in the Front End Web Development course. I finished making this website on June 28, 2021. This website was made as a remake of the 2020 version, using what I learned in the Udacity course until that point to build it. The previous version used bootstrap, whereas this one uses flexbox and grid. The overal layout is also different.
